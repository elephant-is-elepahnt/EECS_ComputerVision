### 1. A1
K-Nearest Neighbor classification

### 2. A2
Use SGD to train linear classifiers and fully connected networks\
fully connceted networks backpropagation

### 3. A3
Modlular API for backpropagation\
Fully-Connected networks\
Dropout\
Update rules : SGD+Momentum, RMSprop, Adam\
Convolutional networks\
Batch normalization\

** In the lecture pdf, it says there's a few hotfixes at this assignment. \
** But I don't have any access to Piazza so I don't know what really is.\
** In Convolution file, I think I made it pretty well but it does not work even if it passes sanity checkes\
** I think the hot fix is related to that

### 4. A4
PyTorch autograd\
Residual networks\
Recurrent neural networks\
Attention\
Feature visualization\
Style transfer\
Adversarial examples

### 5. A5
Single Stage Detector/
Two Stage Detector/
YOLO, RCNN
